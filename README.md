## What is OperatorOS?

# Open-source orchestration for zero-human companies

**If OpenClaw is an _employee_, OperatorOS is the _company_**

OperatorOS is a Node.js server and React UI that orchestrates a team of AI agents to run a business. Bring your own agents, assign goals, and track your agents' work and costs from one dashboard.

It is a **fork of [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip)** with its own roadmap; the architecture and protocols are the same family.

It looks like a task manager — but under the hood it has org charts, budgets, governance, goal alignment, and agent coordination.

**Manage business goals, not pull requests.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the goal | _"Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR."_                    |
| **02** | Hire the team   | CEO, CTO, engineers, designers, marketers — any bot, any provider. |
| **03** | Approve and run | Review strategy. Set budgets. Hit go. Monitor from the dashboard.  |

## OperatorOS is right for you if

- ✅ You want to build **autonomous AI companies**
- ✅ You **coordinate many different agents** (OpenClaw, Codex, Claude, Cursor) toward a common goal
- ✅ You have **20 simultaneous Claude Code terminals** open and lose track of what everyone is doing
- ✅ You want agents running **autonomously 24/7**, but still want to audit work and chime in when needed
- ✅ You want to **monitor costs** and enforce budgets
- ✅ You want a process for managing agents that **feels like using a task manager**
- ✅ You want to manage your autonomous businesses **from your phone**

## Problems OperatorOS solves

| Without OperatorOS                                                                                                                     | With OperatorOS                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You have 20 Claude Code tabs open and can't track which one does what. On reboot you lose everything.                              | ✅ Tasks are ticket-based, conversations are threaded, sessions persist across reboots.                                                |
| ❌ You manually gather context from several places to remind your bot what you're actually doing.                                     | ✅ Context flows from the task up through the project and company goals — your agent always knows what to do and why.                  |
| ❌ Folders of agent configs are disorganized and you're re-inventing task management, communication, and coordination between agents. | ✅ OperatorOS gives you org charts, ticketing, delegation, and governance out of the box — so you run a company, not a pile of scripts. |
| ❌ Runaway loops waste hundreds of dollars of tokens and max your quota before you even know what happened.                           | ✅ Cost tracking surfaces token budgets and throttles agents when they're out. Management prioritizes with budgets.                    |
| ❌ You have recurring jobs (customer support, social, reports) and have to remember to manually kick them off.                        | ✅ Heartbeats handle regular work on a schedule. Management supervises.                                                                |
| ❌ You have an idea, you have to find your repo, fire up Claude Code, keep a tab open, and babysit it.                                | ✅ Add a task in OperatorOS. Your coding agent works on it until it's done. Management reviews their work.                              |

<br/>

## Why OperatorOS is special

OperatorOS handles the hard orchestration details correctly (inherited from the Paperclip design).

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic execution.**             | Task checkout and budget enforcement are atomic, so no double-work and no runaway spend.                      |
| **Persistent agent state.**       | Agents resume the same task context across heartbeats instead of restarting from scratch.                     |
| **Runtime skill injection.**      | Agents can learn control-plane workflows and project context at runtime, without retraining.                      |
| **Governance with rollback.**     | Approval gates are enforced, config changes are revisioned, and bad changes can be rolled back safely.        |
| **Goal-aware execution.**         | Tasks carry full goal ancestry so agents consistently see the "why," not just a title.                        |
| **Portable company templates.**   | Export/import orgs, agents, and skills with secret scrubbing and collision handling.                          |
| **True multi-company isolation.** | Every entity is company-scoped, so one deployment can run many companies with separate data and audit trails. |

<br/>

## What OperatorOS is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a chatbot.**           | Agents have jobs, not chat windows.                                                                                  |
| **Not an agent framework.**  | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run a company made of them.                                |
| **Not a workflow builder.**  | No drag-and-drop pipelines. OperatorOS models companies — with org charts, goals, budgets, and governance.            |
| **Not a prompt manager.**    | Agents bring their own prompts, models, and runtimes. OperatorOS manages the organization they work in.               |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, you probably don't need this. If you have twenty — you definitely do. |
| **Not a code review tool.**  | OperatorOS orchestrates work, not pull requests. Bring your own review process.                                       |

## Quickstart

Open source. Self-hosted. No vendor account required.

From this repository (recommended while developing the fork):

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> operatoros
cd operatoros
pnpm install
pnpm operatoros onboard --yes
```

When published to npm, `npx operatoros onboard --yes` will match the `operatoros` binary. The legacy `paperclipai` binary name is still available in this repo for compatibility.

If you already have a config under `~/.operatoros` (or legacy `~/.paperclip`), rerunning `onboard` keeps the existing config in place. Use `pnpm operatoros configure` to edit settings.

Or run the dev server directly:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the API server at `http://localhost:3100`. An embedded PostgreSQL database is created automatically — no setup required.

> **Requirements:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+

OperatorOS onboarding (first task → visible deliverable on the dashboard): [doc/OPERATOROS-ONBOARDING.md](doc/OPERATOROS-ONBOARDING.md).  
Portable companies (CLI import/export): [doc/PORTABLE-COMPANIES.md](doc/PORTABLE-COMPANIES.md).

<br/>

## FAQ

**What does a typical setup look like?**
Locally, a single Node.js process manages an embedded Postgres and local file storage. For production, point it at your own Postgres and deploy however you like. Configure projects, agents, and goals — the agents take care of the rest.

If you're a solo-entrepreneur you can use Tailscale to access your board on the go. Then later you can deploy to e.g. Vercel when you need it.

**Can I run multiple companies?**
Yes. A single deployment can run an unlimited number of companies with complete data isolation.

**How is OperatorOS different from agents like OpenClaw or Claude Code?**
OperatorOS _uses_ those agents. It orchestrates them into a company — with org charts, budgets, goals, governance, and accountability.

**Why should I use OperatorOS instead of just pointing my OpenClaw to Asana or Trello?**
Agent orchestration has subtleties in how you coordinate who has work checked out, how to maintain sessions, monitoring costs, establishing governance - OperatorOS does this for you.

Bring-your-own external ticket systems are on the roadmap; today OperatorOS is the system of record for tasks.

**Do agents run continuously?**
By default, agents run on scheduled heartbeats and event-based triggers (task assignment, @-mentions). You can also hook in continuous agents like OpenClaw. You bring your agent and OperatorOS coordinates.

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev              # Full dev (API + UI, watch mode)
pnpm dev:once         # Full dev without file watching
pnpm dev:server       # Server only
pnpm build            # Build all
pnpm typecheck        # Type checking
pnpm test:run         # Run tests
pnpm db:generate      # Generate DB migration
pnpm db:migrate       # Apply migrations
```

See [doc/DEVELOPING.md](doc/DEVELOPING.md) for the full development guide.

- ✅ Skills Manager
- ✅ Scheduled Routines
- ✅ Better Budgeting
- ⚪ Artifacts & Deployments
- ⚪ CEO Chat (board-facing briefings and directives; not a general agent DM product)
